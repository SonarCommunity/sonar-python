<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Recursion happens when control enters a loop that has no exit. This can happen when a method invokes itself or when a pair of methods invoke each
other. It can be a useful tool, but unless the method includes a provision to break out of the recursion and <code>return</code>, the recursion will
continue until the stack overflows and the program crashes.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
def my_pow(num, exponent):  # Noncompliant
    num = num * my_pow(num, exponent - 1)
    return num  # this is never reached
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
def my_pow(num, exponent):  # Compliant
    if exponent &gt; 1:
      num = num * my_pow(num, exponent - 1)
    return num
</pre>
