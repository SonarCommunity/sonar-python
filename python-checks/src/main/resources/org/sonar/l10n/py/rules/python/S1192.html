<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Duplicated string literals make the process of refactoring error-prone, since you must be sure to update all occurrences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, constants can be referenced from many places, but only need to be updated in a single place.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<p>With the default threshold of 3:</p>
<pre>
def run():
    prepare("this is a duplicate")  # Noncompliant - "this is a duplicate" is duplicated 3 times
    execute("this is a duplicate")
    release("this is a duplicate")
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
ACTION_1 = "action1"

def run():
    prepare(ACTION_1)
    execute(ACTION_1)
    release(ACTION_1)
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue will be raised on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> duplicated string in decorators </li>
  <li> strings with less than 5 characters </li>
  <li> strings with only letters, numbers and underscores </li>
</ul>
<pre>
@app.route("/api/users/", methods=['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'])
def users():
    pass

@app.route("/api/projects/", methods=['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'])  # Compliant
def projects():
    pass
</pre>
