<p>This rule raises an issue when the identity operator is used with cached literals.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The identity operators <code>is</code> and <code>is not</code> check if the same object is on both sides, i.e. <code>a is b</code> returns
<code>True</code> if <code>id(a) == id(b)</code>.</p>
<p>The CPython interpreter caches certain built-in values for integers, bytes, floats, strings, frozensets and tuples. When a value is cached, all its
references are pointing to the same object in memory; their ids are identical.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates this caching mechanism:</p>
<pre>
my_int = 1
other_int = 1

id(my_int) == id(other_int) # True
</pre>
<p>In both assignments (to <code>my_int</code> and <code>other_int</code>), the assigned value <code>1</code> comes from the interpreter cache, only
one integer object <code>1</code> is created in memory. This means both variables are referencing the same object. For this reason, their ids are
identical and <code>my_int is other_int</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>. This mechanism allows the interpreter for better performance, saving
memory space, by not creating new objects every time for commonly accessed values.</p>
<p>However this caching mechanism does not apply to every value:</p>
<pre>
my_int = 1000

id(my_int) == id(1000) # False
my_int is 1000 # False
</pre>
<p>In this example the integer <code>1000</code> is not cached. Each reference to <code>1000</code> creates an new integer object in memory with a new
id. This means that <code>my_int is 1000</code> is always <code>False</code>, as the two objects have different ids.</p>
<p>This is the reason why using the identity operators on integers, bytes, floats, strings, frozensets and tuples is unreliable as the behavior
changes depending on the value.</p>
<p>Moreover the caching behavior is not part of the Python language specification and could vary between interpreters. CPython 3.8 <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html#changes-in-python-behavior">warns about comparing literals using identity operators</a>.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when at least one operand of an identity operator:</p>
<ul>
  <li> is of type <code>int</code>, <code>bytes</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>frozenset</code> or <code>tuple</code>. </li>
  <li> is a string literal. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to compare these types you should use the equality operators instead <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The only case where the <code>is</code> operator could be used with a cached type is with "interned" strings. The Python interpreter provides a way
to explicitly cache any string literals and benefit from improved performances, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> saved memory space. </li>
  <li> faster string comparison: as only their memory address need to be compared. </li>
  <li> faster dictionary lookup: if the dictionary keys are interned, the lookup can be done by comparing memory address as well. </li>
</ul>
<p>This explicit caching is done through interned strings (i.e. <code>sys.intern("some string")</code>).</p>
<pre>
from sys import intern

my_text = "text"
intern("text") is intern(my_text) # True
</pre>
<p>Note however that interned strings don’t necessarily have the same identity as string literals.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that interned strings may be garbage collected, so in order to benefit from their caching mechanism, a reference to
the interned string should be kept.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use the equality operators (<code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>) to compare <code>int</code>, <code>bytes</code>, <code>float</code>,
<code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code> and string literals.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
my_int = 2000
my_int is 2000 # Noncompliant: the integer 2000 may not be cached, the identity operator could return False.

() is tuple() # Noncompliant: this will return True only because the CPython interpreter cached the empty tuple.
(1,) is tuple([1])  # Noncompliant: comparing non empty tuples will return False as none of these objects are cached.
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
my_int = 2000
my_int == 2000

() == tuple()
(1,) == tuple([1])
</pre>
