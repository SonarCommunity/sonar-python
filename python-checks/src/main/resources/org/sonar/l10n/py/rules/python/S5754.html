<p>This rule raises an issue when a bare <code>except:</code>, an <code>except BaseException</code> or an <code>except SystemExit</code> block does
not re-raise the exception caught.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit"><code>SystemExit</code></a> exception&nbsp;is raised when <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit"><code>sys.exit()</code></a> is called. This exception is used to signal the interpreter to
exit. The exception is expected to propagate up until the program stops. It is possible to catch this exception in order to perform, for example,
clean-up tasks. It should, however, be raised again to allow the interpreter to exit as expected. Not re-raising such exception could lead to
undesired behaviour.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement">bare <code>except:</code> statement</a>, i.e. an
<code>except</code> block without any exception class, is equivalent to <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException"><code>except BaseException</code></a>. Both statements will catch every
exceptions, including <code>SystemExit</code>. It is recommended to catch instead a more specific exception. If it is not possible, the exception
should be raised again.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to re-raise the <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt"><code>KeyboardInterrupt</code></a> exception. Similarly to
<code>SystemExit</code>,<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> is used to signal the interpreter to exit. Not re-raising such exception could also lead to
undesired behaviour.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Re-raise <code>SystemExit</code>, <code>BaseException</code> and any exceptions caught in a bare <code>except</code> clause.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
try:
    ...
except SystemExit:  # Noncompliant: the SystemExit exception is not re-raised.
    pass

try:
    ...
except BaseException:  # Noncompliant: BaseExceptions encompass SystemExit exceptions and should be re-raised.
    pass

try:
    ...
except:  # Noncompliant: exceptions caught by this statement should be re-raised or a more specific exception should be caught.
    pass
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
try:
    ...
except SystemExit as e:
    ...
    raise e

try:
    ...
except BaseException as e:
    ...
    raise e

try:
    ...
except FileNotFoundError:
    ... # Handle a more specific exception
</pre>
