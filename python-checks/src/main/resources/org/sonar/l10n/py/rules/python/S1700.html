<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s confusing to have a class member with the same name (case differences aside) as its enclosing class. This is particularly so when you consider
the common practice of naming a class instance for the class itself.</p>
<p>Best practice dictates that any field or member with the same name as the enclosing class be renamed to be more descriptive of the particular
aspect of the class it represents or holds.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
class Foo:
  foo = ''

  def getFoo(self):
    ...

foo = Foo()
foo.getFoo() # what does this return?
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
class Foo:
  name = ''

  def getName(self):
    ...

foo = Foo()
foo.getName()
</pre>
