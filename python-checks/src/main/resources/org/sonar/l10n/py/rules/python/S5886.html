<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Developers can use type hints to specify which type a function is expected to return. These annotations are not enforced at runtime and returning a
different type might not fail. It is however likely to be unintended and will lead to maintainability issues, if not bugs.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a function or method returns a value that contradicts its type hint.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
def hello() -&gt; str:
    return 42  # Noncompliant. Function's type hint asks for a string return value
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
def hello() -&gt; str:
    return "Hello"
</pre>
