<p>Private attributes which are written but never read are a case of "dead store". Changing their value is useless and most probably indicates an
error in the code.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Python has no real private attribute. Every attribute is accessible. There are however two conventions indicating that an attribute is not meant to
be "public":</p>
<ul>
  <li> attributes with a name starting with a single underscore (ex: <code>_myattribute</code>) should be seen as non-public and might change without
  prior notice. They should not be used by third-party libraries or software. It is ok to use those methods inside the library defining them but it
  should be done with caution. </li>
  <li> "class-private" attributes have a name starting with at least two underscores and ending with at most one underscore. These attributes' names
  will be automatically mangled to avoid collision with subclasses' attributes. For example <code>__myattribute</code> will be renamed as
  <code>_classname__myattribute</code>, where <code>classname</code> is the attribute’s class name without its leading underscore(s). They shouldn’t
  be used outside of the class defining the attribute. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a class-private attribute (two leading underscores, max one underscore at the end) is never read inside the class.
It optionally raises an issue on unread attributes prefixed with a single underscore. Both class attributes and instance attributes will raise an
issue.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Remove the attribute or fix the code to read it.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre>
class Noncompliant:
    _class_attr = 0  # Noncompliant if enable_single_underscore_issues is enabled
    __mangled_class_attr = 1  # Noncompliant

    def __init__(self, value):
        self._attr = 0  # Noncompliant if enable_single_underscore_issues is enabled
        self.__mangled_attr = 1  # Noncompliant

    def compute(self, x):
        return x * x
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre>
class Compliant:
    _class_attr = 0
    __mangled_class_attr = 1

    def __init__(self, value):
        self._attr = 0
        self.__mangled_attr = 1

    def compute(self, x):
        return x * Compliant._class_attr * Compliant.__mangled_class_attr * self._attr * self.__mangled_attr
</pre>
