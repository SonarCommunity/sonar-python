<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The length of a collection is always greater than or equal to zero. Testing it doesnâ€™t make sense, since the result is always
<code>true</code>.</p>
<pre>
mylist = []
if len(myList) &gt;= 0:  # Noncompliant: always true
    pass
</pre>
<p>Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre>
if len(myList) &lt; 0:  # Noncompliant: always false
    pass
----
</pre>
<p>Fix the code to properly check for emptiness if it was the intent, or remove the redundant code to keep the current behavior.</p>
