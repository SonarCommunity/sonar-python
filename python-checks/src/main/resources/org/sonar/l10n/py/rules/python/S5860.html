<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Why use named groups only to never use any of them later on in the code?</p>
<p>This rule raises issues every time named groups are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> referenced while not defined; </li>
  <li> defined but called elsewhere in the code by their number instead. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
import re

def foo():
    pattern = re.compile(r"(?P&lt;a&gt;.)")
    matches = pattern.match("abc")
    g1 = matches.group("b") # Noncompliant - group "b" is not defined
    g2 = matches.group(1) # Noncompliant - Directly use 'a' instead of its group number.
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
import re

def foo():
    pattern = re.compile(r"(?P&lt;a&gt;.)")
    matches = pattern.match("abc")
    g = matches.group("a")
</pre>
