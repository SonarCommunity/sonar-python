<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Nested conditionals are hard to read and can make the order of operations complex to understand.</p>
<pre>
class Job:
    @property
    def readable_status(self):
        return "Running" if job.is_running else "Failed" if job.errors else "Succeeded"  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>Instead, use another line to express the nested operation in a separate statement.</p>
<pre>
class Job:
    @property
    def readable_status(self):
        if job.is_running:
            return "Running"
        return "Failed" if job.errors else "Succeeded"
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue is raised on conditional expressions in comprehensions.</p>
<pre>
job_statuses = ["Running" if job.is_running else "Failed" if job.errors else "Succeeded" for job in jobs]  # Compliant by exception
</pre>
