<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. This rule allows to check that all class names match a provided regular
expression.</p>
<p>The default regular expression is based on PEP-8 standard. It allows "CapWords" convention and "snake_case" in lowercase. The "snake_case"
convention is accepted by PEP-8 when the class is primarily used as a callable (ex: decorator, context manager, etc…​). However the "CapWords"
convention is recommended in every case.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<p>With default provided regular expression <code>^_?([A-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*|[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)$</code>:</p>
<pre>
class myClass:  # Noncompliant
   ...

class my_CONTEXT_manager:  # Noncompliant
    def __enter__(self):
        pass
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        pass
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
class MyClass:
   ...

class my_context_manager:
    def __enter__(self):
        pass
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        pass
</pre>
