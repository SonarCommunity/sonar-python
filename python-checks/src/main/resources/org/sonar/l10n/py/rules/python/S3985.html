<p>This rule raises an issue when a private nested class is never used.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>"Private" nested classes that are never used inside the enclosing class are usually dead code: unnecessary, inoperative code that should be
removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand the program and preventing bugs from
being introduced.</p>
<p>Python has no real private classes. Every class is accessible. There are however two conventions indicating that a class is not meant to be
"public":</p>
<ul>
  <li> classes with a name starting with a single underscore (ex: <code>_MyClass</code>) should be seen as non-public and might change without prior
  notice. They should not be used by third-party libraries or software. It is ok to use those classes inside the library defining them but it should
  be done with caution. </li>
  <li> "class-private" classes are defined inside another class, and have a name starting with at least two underscores and ending with at most one
  underscore. These classes' names will be automatically mangled to avoid collision with subclasses' nested classes. For example
  <code>__MyClass</code> will be renamed as <code>_classname__MyClass</code>, where <code>classname</code> is the enclosing class’s name without its
  leading underscore(s). Class-Private classes shouldn’t be used outside of their enclosing class. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a private nested class (either with one or two leading underscores) is never used inside its parent class.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class TopLevel:
    class __Nested():  # Noncompliant: __Nested is never used
        pass
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class TopLevel:
    class __Nested():
        pass

    def process(self):
        return TopLevel.__Nested()
</pre>
