<p>Jump statements, such as <code>return</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> let you change the default flow of program execution,
but jump statements that direct the control flow to the original direction are just a waste of keystrokes.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
def redundant_jump(x):
    if x == 1:
        print(True)
        return  # NonCompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
def redundant_jump(x):
    if x == 1:
        print(True)
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> No issue is raised if the jump statement is the only statement of a statement suite: </li>
</ul>
<pre>
def my_function(x):
    if x &gt; 5:
        do_something()
    elif x == 0:
        return # ok even it could be changed to "pass"
    else:
        do_something_else()
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> No issue is raised for <code>return None</code> because this was certainly done on purpose to be explicit that a function is really returning
  <code>None</code>. </li>
</ul>
