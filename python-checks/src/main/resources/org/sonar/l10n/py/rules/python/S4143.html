<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of
"dead store".</p>
<pre>
def swap(mylist, index1, index2):
    tmp = mylist[index2]
    mylist[index2] = mylist[index1]
    mylist[index2] = tmp  # Noncompliant

list2 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
list2[3:5] = [42,42]
list2[3:5] = [42,42]  # Noncompliant

mymap = {'a': {}}
mymap['a']['b'] = 42
mymap['a']['b'] = 42  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>At best it is redundant and will confuse the reader, most often it is an error and not what the developer intended to do.</p>
