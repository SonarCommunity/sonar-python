<p>Calling the <code>not</code> or <code>~</code> prefix operator twice might be redundant: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are
typically caused by accidentally double-tapping the key in question without noticing. Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be
called once, or misleading if done on purpose. Calling <code>not</code> twice is commonly done instead of using the dedicated "bool()" builtin
function. However, the latter one increases the code readability and should be used.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
a = 0
b = False

c = not not a # Noncompliant
d = ~~b # Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
a = 0
b = False

c = bool(a)
d = ~b
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>If the <code>~</code> function has been overloaded in a customised class and has been called twice, no warning is raised as it is assumed to be an
expected usage.</p>
