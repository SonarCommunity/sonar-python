<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The repetition of a prefix operator (<code>not</code> or <code>~</code>) is usually a typo. The second operator invalidates the first one:</p>
<pre>
a = False
b = ~~a # Noncompliant: equivalent to "a"
</pre>
<p>While calling <code>not</code> twice is equivalent to calling the <code>bool()</code> built-in function, the latter increases the code readability,
so it should be preferred.</p>
<pre>
a = 0

b = not not a # Noncompliant: use bool()
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The rule does not raise an issue if the <code>~</code> function is overloaded in a customized class, as it is assumed to be the expected usage.</p>
