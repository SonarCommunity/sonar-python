<p>This rule raises an issue when the first parameter of a class method is not an accepted name.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>By convention, the first argument in a class method, i.e. methods decorated with <code>@classmethod</code>, is named <code>cls</code> as a
representation and a reminder that the argument is the class itself. If you were to name the argument something else, you would stand a good chance of
confusing both users and maintainers of the code. It might also indicate that the <code>cls</code> parameter was forgotten, in which case calling the
method will most probably fail. This rule also applies to methods <code>__init_subclass__</code>, <code>__class_getitem__</code> and
<code>__new__</code> as their first argument is always the class instead of "self".</p>
<p>By default this rule accepts <code>cls</code> and <code>mcs</code>, which is sometime used in metaclasses, as valid names for class parameters. You
can set your own list of accepted names via the parameter <code>classParameterNames</code>.</p>
<h3>How to fix it</h3>
<p>Follow the naming convention for the first parameter name of a class method.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class Rectangle(object):

  @classmethod
  def area(bob, height, width):  #Noncompliant
    return height * width
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class Rectangle(object):

  @classmethod
  def area(cls, height, width):
    return height * width
</pre>
