<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An empty code block is confusing. It will require some effort from maintainers to determine if it is intentional or indicates the implementation is
incomplete.</p>
<pre>
# Noncompliant: is the block empty on purpose, or is code missing?
for i in range(3):
    pass
</pre>
<p>Removing or filling the empty code blocks takes away ambiguity and generally results in a more straightforward and less surprising code. ===
Exceptions</p>
<p>The rule ignores code blocks that contain comments.</p>
