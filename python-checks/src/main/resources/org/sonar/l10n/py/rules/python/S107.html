<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Functions, methods, or lambdas with a long parameter list are difficult to use, as maintainers must figure out the role of each parameter and keep
track of their position.</p>
<pre>
def set_coordinates(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2): # Noncompliant
    # ...
</pre>
<p>The solution can be to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Split the function, method, or lambda into smaller ones </li>
</ul>
<pre>
# Each function does a part of what the original set_coordinates function was doing, so confusion risks are lower
def set_origin(x, y, z):
   # ...

def set_size(width, height, depth):
   # ...
</pre>
<ul>
  <li> Find a better data structure for the parameters that group data in a way that makes sense for the specific application domain </li>
</ul>
<pre>
@dataclass
class Point: # In geometry, Point is a logical structure to group data
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int

def set_coordinates(p1: Point, p2: Point):
    # ...
</pre>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a function, a method, or a lambda has more parameters than the provided threshold.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The first argument of non-static methods, i.e., <code>self</code> or <code>cls</code>, is not counted as it is mandatory and passed
automatically.</p>
