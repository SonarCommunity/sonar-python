<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>An <code>except</code> clause that only rethrows the caught exception has the same effect as omitting the <code>except</code> altogether and
letting it bubble up automatically.</p>
<pre>
a = {}
try:
    a[5]
except KeyError:
    raise  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<p>Such clauses should either be removed or populated with the appropriate logic.</p>
<pre>
a = {}
try:
    a[5]
except KeyError as e:
    logging.exception('error while accessing the dict')
    raise e
</pre>
