<p>This rule raises an issue when the same value is used multiple times when instantiating a set literal.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>By definition, a set cannot hold the same value multiple times. When instantiating a set literal with the same value repeated multiple times, only
the last occurrence of the duplicated value will remain.</p>
<p>Creating a set with redundant elements is prone to errors and confusion. A duplicated value in a set literal should be either:</p>
<ul>
  <li> modified, as it was mistakenly put in the set instead an actual value which would lead to bugs and errors further in the program. </li>
  <li> removed, as it was a simple duplication, making the code confusing and difficult to maintain. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
{"one", "two", "one"}  # Noncompliant: the value "one" is duplicated.

def func(a1, a2, a3):
    {a1, a2, a1}  # Noncompliant: the value a1 is duplicated.
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
{"one", "two", "three"}

def func(a1, a2, a3):
    {a1, a2, a3}
</pre>
