<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>By default, only dictionary objects can be serialized in Django JSON-encoded response. Before ECMASCript 5, serializing non-dictionary objects
could lead to security vulnerabilities. Since most modern browsers implement ECMAScript 5, this vector of attack is no longer a threat and it is
possible to serialize non-dictionary objects by setting the <code>safe</code> flag to <code>False</code>. However, if this flag is not set, a
<code>TypeError</code> will be thrown by the serializer.</p>
<p>Despite this possibility, it is still recommended to serialize dictionary objects, as an API based on <code>dict</code> is generally more
extensible and easier to maintain.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>To fix this issue, developers should ensure that the safe flag is set to "False" when attempting to serialize non-dictionary objects in Django.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre>
from django.http import JsonResponse
response = JsonResponse([1, 2, 3])
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre>
from django.http import JsonResponse
response = JsonResponse([1, 2, 3], safe=False)
</pre>
