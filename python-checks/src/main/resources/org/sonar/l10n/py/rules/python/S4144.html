<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Two functions having the same implementation are suspicious. It might be that something else was intended. Or the duplication is intentional, which
becomes a maintenance burden.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class MyClass:
    code = "secret"

    def calculate_code(self):
        self.do_the_thing()
        return self.__class__.code

    def get_name(self):  # Noncompliant: duplicates calculate_code
        self.do_the_thing()
        return self.__class__.code

    def do_the_thing(self):
        pass  # on purpose
</pre>
<p>If the identical logic is intentional, the code should be refactored to avoid duplication. For example, by having both functions call the same
function or by having one implementation invoke the other.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">

    def calculate_code(self):

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue will be raised on empty methods/functions and methods/functions with only one line of code.</p>
